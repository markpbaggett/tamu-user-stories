=========================
File Types and Work Types
=========================

-----------
Description
-----------

Not all files or works are the same. Librarians need to be able to state what a work is and have that work receive different
treatment in terms of interoperability. This could mean the ability to upload a GIS data set to a work that goes with images
but not have it be treated as a canvas.  Instead, it becomes a downloadable binary from the parent resource.

-------
Request
-------

I want to be able to state what a file or work is so that it is treated differently in interoperable systems.

-------------------
Acceptance Criteria
-------------------

* A controlled set of work types are prescribed unless determined to be unneeded or unnecessary by developers.
* A controlled set of files types are adopted and those are setable by librarians on ingest.
