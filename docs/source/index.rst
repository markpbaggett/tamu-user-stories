TAMU Digital Collections User Stories
=====================================

This portal captures user stories for various needs related to digital collections in digital initiatives.

The stories are split into various categories with the intent that this will help us more easily divide and organize
work.  Each story follows a standard template. The :code:`Description` section provides background about the user story
and why it is being requested. The :code:`Request` section is a concise phrase capturing what is being requested. The
:code:`Acceptance Criteria` section captures what is expected in order for that user story to be marked as complete. The
:code:`Notes or Examples` section captures additional information to help a developer or other technical party understand
what is being requested.  Finally, a user story may have a section called :code:`Priority`.  When present, this represents
something that would be nice to have but not a :code:`MUST`.
